# Sample Document for RAG System

## Introduction
This is a sample document to demonstrate the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system.
The system uses advanced natural language processing to answer questions based on document content.

## Key Features
1. Document Ingestion: Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, and MD files
2. Intelligent Chunking: Splits documents while preserving context
3. Vector Search: Uses embeddings for semantic similarity
4. Citation: Always cites sources in responses

## Technical Details
The system uses:
- OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- Claude Sonnet 4 for generation
- LangChain for orchestration

## Use Cases
Common applications include:
- Knowledge base Q&A
- Document analysis
- Research assistance
- Customer support automation
